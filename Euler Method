# Constants
m = 100  # Mass of the water in kg
cp = 4186  # Specific heat capacity of water (J/kg·K)
h = 500  # Convective heat transfer coefficient (W/m²·K)
A_element = 0.793  # Surface area of the heating element in m²
A_gyser = 5.0  # Surface area of the geyser walls in m²
T_element = 100  # Surface temperature of the heating element in °C
k = 15  # Thermal conductivity of the geyser walls (W/m·K)
dx = 0.0015  # Thickness of the geyser walls in meters
T_ambient = 25  # Ambient temperature outside in °C
dt = 0.01  # Time step in hours

# Initial temperature of the fluid

# Function for convection (heating element on)
def convection_step(T_fluid, dt):
    Q_conv = h * A_element * (T_element - T_fluid)  # Convection heat input
    dT_conv = (Q_conv / (m * cp)) * dt  # Temperature change due to convection
    return T_fluid + dT_conv

# Function for conduction (heat loss)
def conduction_step(T_fluid, dt):
    Q_cond = k * A_gyser * (T_fluid - T_ambient) / dx  # Conduction heat loss
    dT_cond = (Q_cond / (m * cp)) * dt  # Temperature change due to conduction

# Example usage of the two steps (separately executed based on conditions)
# Convection: When the heating element is on
T_fluid = convection_step(T_fluid, dt)

# Conduction: When heat is being lost to the environment
T_fluid = conduction_step(T_fluid, dt)
